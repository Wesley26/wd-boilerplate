Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Implements [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [PostCSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss), and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/react).

# Information

## Important Instructions

- When installing for the first time, run `npm install`. 
- For Tailwind CSS dependency, make sure to run `npm run build:css` if you do not see tailwind.css. Tailwind.css file is ignored. This command will automatically run everytime you use `npm start`.

## Purpose of Repo

This repo is my boilerplate template for future website designs. It is currently a work in progress and will be updated as I build. This readme will be updated as I add more to this boilerplate template design.
